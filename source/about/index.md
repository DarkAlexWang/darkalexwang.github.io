# About Me
![](/uploads/avatar.jpg)
I got my PhD in Drexel University, and currently working as a Materials Scientist.
However, I am very interested in building software applications and website services.
During my spare time, I worked on multiple projects about web service and Android applications.
Currently, I am looking for an entry-level software developer position.
If you have any openings and thought I am a good fit, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.
