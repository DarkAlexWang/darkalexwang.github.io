# First Met
Life is full of coincidence, we never met with each other although we attended the same school, lived in the same place for over 7 years, right, including Bachelor\'s. Then, we met at here as alumni.

# Social App
I thought you were cute during the meet up of alumnis, but never think about you are single. Couple of months later, we liked each other on CMB, added wechat contact. Everything starts now....

That day is June 6, 2019.

# Table Tennis
Started chatting on and off, you always replied with delay, but we still want to give it a try at Swan, this should be the second time we meet with each other on June 14.

# Filoli Garden
We went to this garden together, talked more and tried to understand each other.
Suddently, realized that we have a lot in common. But the garden itself was just so ordinary, and I probably wont go back again.

# Band Performance
You are always busy about the band rehearsal, so we studied at cafeteria and eat together. I said I like you on June 30th for the first time, next day you said I should speak with you in person.

Your band had this perfect live performace.

# Sorry about the ring
Something I did not think through, and made a mistake, hopefully, you understand that I love you.
I would love to be with you for the rest of my life, and be at your side no matter what happened in the future.
We already know each other for one year, now it is the time to move one step further.

# To be continue...
There is a lot of things we can do and places we can go to together, like air balloon ride and Hawaii.
Now the questions is...
